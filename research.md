      <br> Interleaving distance is a measure of similarity between persistence modules and it's been a central concept in algebraic topology and topological data analysis. Through a guiding example, this video introduces categorical flowsâ€”a functorial operation that extends the interleaving distance into a measure between objects of virtually any category.

      <h2> Revealing brain network dynamics during the emotional state of suspense using topological data analysis </h2>
<p>
     <img src = "../images/chosen_mapper.png" alt="Mapper graph" >
      <br>  We applied a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/SPBG.SPBG07.091-100" target=_blank > Mapper </a>,  to find the relation of brain dynamics and suspense. As result, we found changes in the functional connectivity within and between large-scale networks associated with the level of suspense.

      <h2> Persistent Homology for clusterization of RNA secondary structures </h2>
     <img src = "../images/comp_bar20.gif" alt="persistent homology 	animation">
      <p> As part of my <a href="../docs/Thesis_Persistent_homology_analysis_of_RNA_secondary_structures.pdf" target=_blank > bachelor's thesis </a> I worked with Professors Gustavo Rubiano and Clara Bermudez applying persistent homology to cluster RNA secondary structures. We interpreted the 0-homology classes (connected-components) as clusters, resulting a method comparable to hierarchical clustering. </p>
