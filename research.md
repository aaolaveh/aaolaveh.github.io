      <h2> Revealing brain network dynamics during the emotional state of suspense using topological data analysis </h2>
     <img src = "../images/chosen_mapper.png" alt="Mapper graph" >
      <p> <br> In my <a href="https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/81235" target=_blank > master's thesis </a>, supervised by Professors <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/fagomezj/" target=_blank> Francisco Gomez </a>  and <a href = "https://www.joperea.com/" target=_blank> Jose Perea </a>  we applied a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/SPBG.SPBG07.091-100" target=_blank > Mapper </a>,  to find the relation of brain dynamics and suspense. As result, we found changes in the functional connectivity within and between large-scale networks associated with the level of suspense. See <a href="../papers" > Papers </a> for the preprint version.  <br> <br>  </p>

      <h2> Persistent Homology for clusterization of RNA secondary structures </h2>
     <img src = "../images/comp_bar20.gif" alt="persistent homology 	animation">
      <p> As part of my <a href="../docs/Thesis_Persistent_homology_analysis_of_RNA_secondary_structures.pdf" target=_blank > bachelor's thesis </a> I worked with Professors Gustavo Rubiano and Clara Bermudez applying persistent homology to cluster RNA secondary structures. We interpreted the 0-homology classes (connected-components) as clusters, resulting a method comparable to hierarchical clustering. </p>
