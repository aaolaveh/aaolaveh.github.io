      <h2> Persistent Homology for clusterization of RNA secondary structures </h2>
     <img src = "../images/comp_bar20.gif" alt="persistent homology 	animation"> 
      <p>As part of my <a href="../docs/Thesis_Persistent_homology_analysis_of_RNA_secondary_structures.pdf" target=_blank > bachelor's thesis </a> I worked with Professors Gustavo Rubiano and Clara Bermudez applying persistent homology to cluster RNA secondary structures. We interpreted the 0-homology classes (connected-components) as clusters, resulting a method comparable to hierarchical clustering. </p>
