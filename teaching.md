      <h2> Certification in College Teaching (CCT) </h2>
           <p> This  <a href="/Portfolio/teaching_portfolio/" target=_self> portfolio </a> presents the learning experiences completed as part of the CCT program offered by Michigan State University. These include participating in a series of teaching-focused workshops, attending a course on teaching college mathematics and conducting a mentored  research project on how students perceive an AI tutor in college algebra. </p>
