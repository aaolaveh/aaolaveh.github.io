<h1> Students’ perspectives of the use of Khanmigo as a
mathematics AI tutor </h1>


<div class="block">
This study explores college students’ experiences using an AI tutor to support their math learning. Specifically, we conducted a focus group interview of around 50 students in two sections of a college algebra class and had access to the assistance of Khanmigo, an AI-powered tutor by Khan Academy.  The results show that students generally have a positive experience using Khanmigo and other generate AIs to complete their assignments and study for their exams. Overall, students have learned to appreciate the benefits of using this technology but also recognize and handle the limitations of these novel tools. Most of them are willing to continue using them to support their academic endeavors. 

 
Drawing on students’ perspectives, we identified several benefits of using Khanmigo, such as being an immediate guide that can be accessed anytime, anywhere, as well as its ability to generate useful practice problems accompanied by clear, step-by-step explanations. In contrast, students also noted certain drawbacks, including the perception that responses were sometimes overly slow or excessively detailed, and that the AI struggled with more complex problems. Based on these insights, we offer recommendations for the effective integration of Khanmigo into classroom instruction. Overall, our findings provide a valuable foundation for reflecting on both, the promise and the challenges of generative AI as a supportive tool in students’ learning process.
