<h1> Creating effective learning environments </h1>



This competency involved attending the workshop session "Infusing Active Learning with Inclusive Practices". The main objectives for the participants is examining the integration of inquiry, inclusion active learning in classroom as well as incorporating active learning strategies in their own classrooms.

This ability focuses on strategies that promote questioning, comparison of ideas, problem solving, participation and communication skills. This competency involves integrating active learning techniques, such as group work, applications of concepts to real life problems, small and large group discussions and interactive lectures.

      <h2> Description </h2>
	<p> Learning is the action of gaining knowledge or a skill in (something) by study, experience, or being taught.  One way of learning is active learning, where the knowledge or the skill is gained by engaging actions. This way of learning is intended to:

-	Create better understanding
-	Make fun and easy the learning process
-	Promote questioning and the comparison of ideas	-	Promote the application of concepts to real life problems
-	Promote communication skills
There are different strategies for active learning that can be ordered in a spectrum that ranges from simple to complex tasks. Complex tasks are not inherently better. The choice of strategy depends on the content, context and time. The most common strategies I used in my class are pause for reflection, group discussions and problem solving.

Active learning should be accompanied by effective and inclusive teaching strategies. As instructors, we are responsible for creating active supporting learning environments for our students. Some strategies I use in my classroom to create them are:

-	Introducing myself in the first class and creating an introduction activity to get to know my students.
-	Making nametags with the students such that we all know our names.
-	Present the classroom and group work guidelines on the first day of class.
-	Ask engaging and leading questions during lecture time.
-	Promote self and group problem solving
