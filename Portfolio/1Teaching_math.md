<h1> Teaching College Mathematics </h1>

This ability involves being informed of the current state, guidelines and standards for the teaching of mathematical sciences, understanding the mathematical core ideas a student should develop and knowing strategies of active learning using technology to promote understanding and assessing student learning. Then, it naturally implies applying this knowledge to design curriculum and learning activities, create effective learning environments and foster mathematical thinking among students.

      <h2> Description </h2>
<p>

To develop this competency I participated in the class "Teaching College Mathematics". The course is designed for future faculty members who expect to teach courses in the mathematical sciences. The main objectives for the learners are discovering the recent research related to the teaching and learning of the mathematical sciences at the collegiate level and applying the acquired knowledge to their own practice.
</p>

<p>
You can check the <a href= "/docs/class/syllabus.pdf" target=_blank > syllabus </a> of the class to know all the details. In a nutshell, we completed weekly readings and reflections, lead and participated in discussions, and engaged in group activities and projects.  Discussion topics included our own teaching and learning experiences, the current state and guidelines of mathematics education, the core principles of mathematical understanding, and strategies for implementing active learning in math lessons. We also developed a personalized framework for designing mathematical tasks and, working in groups, created example lessons based on these frameworks. 
</p>

<p>
Each student led a discussion on a topic of personal interest. Topics covered included mathematics self-efficacy and intervention practices, adult learners, trauma-informed approaches to mathematics instruction, the role of undergraduate learning assistants in classroom pedagogy, student–teacher relationships, and generative AI in education, the latter was co-led by me and a fellow student.

Below, you will find the framework I developed for designing mathematical tasks with a learning seen through the framework . Also you can find my summaries and reflections on the papers I reviewed about generative AI in mathematics education.

      <h2> Reflection </h2>
<p>

I wrote the following paragraph at the beginning of the class:

<blockquote>
I hope to use this class as an opportunity to improve my teaching philosophy and move beyond relying on my own personal experiences. By deepening my understanding of educational theory and engaging in peer discussions, I would develop a broad and solid comprehension of my teaching methods.  Also, I struggle with being accountable when I work for and by myself. This class will provide the structure and accountability I need to stay focused on reading the materials and developing a portfolio and a teaching project. I am prepared to work hard and sincerely on the assignments and projects. I will actively participate in the discussions with my peers and overall do my best in the class. 
</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
I consider that I did achieve my goal.  I greatly benefit from reading the suggested papers and reflecting on them. The readings were enriched by the opportunity to share my thoughts and reflections with my peers. Overall, I found most activities to be meaningful experiences in this class that indeed deepened my understanding of educational theory and helped me acquire a better understanding of my own teaching and my future teaching project.
<p>
</p>
For example, in the <a href= "https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/cupmguide_print.pdf" target=_blank > ‘2015  CUPM Curriculum Guide to Majors in Mathematical Sciences’ </a> I learned about the current guidelines of math education as well as the learning goals for students learning mathematics. I found the text to be relevant, pertinent, realistic, personalized and caring. I am amused by the idea that most of the current Mathematics’ departments in and out of the USA follow this or similar guidance when developing and articulating the guiding goals of their program. Moreover, each program is encouraged to create objectives according to their context. A math department in rural Pennsylvania should not be a copy of Oxford’s math department and vice versa. Additionally, it gave me context of the classes I am teaching in MSU. I would like to have these guidelines in mind when I am designing and executing a lesson.
<p>
</p>
I was captivated by two readings about <a herf="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5951/jresematheduc.47.2.0162" target=_blank> ‘Lectures in Advanced Mathematics: Why Students Might Not Understand What the Mathematics Professor Is Trying to Convey’ </a>  and
<a herf="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.17-07-0149" target=_blank> ‘Teacher Knowledge for Active-Learning Instruction: Expert–Novice Comparison Reveals Differences’ </a>. My main highlight is how we as instructors should develop knowledge and skills necessary to effectively implement active learning strategies. For example, capture the elements students note the most  in a lecture and highlighted them in our lessons. At the same time, it is crucial that we have the time and opportunities to try and fail to develop such learning strategies.
<p>
</p>
Overall, this course was an enriching experience that deepened my understanding of mathematics education while expanding my perspectives as both a learner and an educator. I want to continue improving my practical skills, theorical knowledge and my enthusiasm to achieve my goal of being a mathematics professor.
