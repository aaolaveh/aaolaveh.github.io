      <h2> Teaching Philosophy </h2>

<p>I decided to pursue a PhD because I want to be a professor. As an educator, I aim to create a personalized experience for my students, make them feel I care about them individually. This means supporting them <em> inside the classroom </em> by helping them to master the art of doing mathematics trough repetition, independent problem-solving, and collaborative work and 
<em> outside the classroom </em>, remaining mindful of the responsibilities and their interests beyond academia. In both contexts, my goal is to nurture their growth through a holistic appreciation of their humanity. <br>
If you are curious on how these ideas shape my teaching, you can explore my <a href="/docs/still_working.pdf" target=_blank > full statement </a>

      <h2> Certification in College Teaching </h2>


<p>  Through the Certification in College Teaching (CCT) program at Michigan State University  I developed five key competencies that strengthen my effectiveness as an educator. These include teaching college mathematics, implementing active learning and conducting a mentored research project on how students perceive an AI tutor in college algebra. </p>
