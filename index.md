Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a doctoral student of mathematics at <a href="https://math.msu.edu/" target=_blank > Michigan State University </a> (MSU). My advisor is Professor <a href="http://elizabethmunch.com/" target=_blank > Elizabeth Munch </a> and we are currently working on interleaving distances for posets.

Prior to MSU, I completed my MSc in Applied Mathematics in <a href="https://unal.edu.co/" target=_blank > La Universidad Nacional de Colombia </a> in 2021. I completed my B.Sc in Mathematics at the same university (with honors) in 2018.

Currently I am working bounding interleaving distances on concrete categories using a loss function and a family of interleaving distances defined on partial ordered sets.

More information can be found in my <a href="../docs/CV_Astrid_Olave.pdf" target=_blank> CV </a>.
