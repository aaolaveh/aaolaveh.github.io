<p>I'm a master student of Applied Mathematics in <a href="https://unal.edu.co/" target=_blank > La Universidad Nacional de Colombia </a>. I completed my B.Sc in Mathematics at the same university (with honors) in 2018.</p> 

<p> My current research is in topological data analysis (<a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/SPBG.SPBG07.091-100" target=_blank > Mapper </a>) applied to dynamic brain networks. </p>

More information can be found in my <a href="./CV_Astrid_Olave.pdf" target=_blank> CV </a>.
