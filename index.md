---

I'm a doctoral student of mathematics at <a href="https://msu.edu/" target=_blank > Michigan State University </a> (MSU). My advisor is Professor <a href="http://elizabethmunch.com/" target=_blank > Elizabeth Munch </a> and we are currently working on interleaving distances for posets.

Prior to MSU, I completed my MSc in Applied Mathematics in <a href="https://unal.edu.co/" target=_blank > La Universidad Nacional de Colombia </a> in 2021. I completed my B.Sc in Mathematics at the same university (with honors) in 2018.

My <a href="https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/81235?show=full" target=_blank > former research </a> is in topological data analysis applied to dynamic brain networks.

More information can be found in my <a href="../docs/CV_Astrid_Olave.pdf" target=_blank> CV </a>.

## Research interests:


- Algebraic topology
- Topological data analysis:
Foundations and applications
