I'm a doctoral student of mathematics at <a href="https://msu.edu/" target=_blank > Michigan State University </a> (MSU).

Prior to MSU, I completed my MSc in Applied Mathematics in <a href="https://unal.edu.co/" target=_blank > La Universidad Nacional de Colombia </a> in 2021. I completed my B.Sc in Mathematics at the same university (with honors) in 2018. 

My former research is in topological data analysis (<a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/SPBG.SPBG07.091-100" target=_blank > Mapper </a>) applied to dynamic brain networks. 

More information can be found in my <a href="../docs/CV_Astrid_Olave.pdf" target=_blank> CV </a>. 

## Research interests: 


- Algebraic topology 
- Topological data analysis:
Foundations and applications 
- Computational biology
